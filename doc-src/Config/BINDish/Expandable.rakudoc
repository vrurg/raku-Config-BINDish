=head1 NAME

C<Config::BINDish::Expandable> - C<Config::BINDish> extension implmeneting expandable strings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends
L<C<Config::BINDish>|rakudoc:Config::BINDish>
with strings which can include other option values. Only double-quoted string (i.e. those for which
L<C<Config::BINDish::Grammar::Value>|rakudoc:Config::BINDish::Grammar::Value>
and
L<C<Config::BINDish::AST::Value>|rakudoc:Config::BINDish::AST::Value>
have type name set to I<dq-string>) are expandable.

To incorporate a value into a string the following macro format is used:

    '{' <option> | <option-path> | '$' <environment-variable> ['?'] '}'

=head2 Option

I<option> is a plain string naming an option from the current block:

    server "S1" {
        name "server.local";
        description "{name} is a mock server"; # becomes "server.local is a mock server"
    }

=head2 Option Path

I<option-path> defines a path to the option if it is located in another block. It consist of a list of blocks in the
order of nesting and must end with an option name. Elements in a path are separated with a slash (C</>) symbol.

The path can be relative or absolute. Absolute paths are started with a slash:

    base-url "https://localhost"
    resource "Test" {
        url "{/base-url}/test";
    }

Relative paths can use double-dot notation to refer to a parent block:

    pool "shared" {
        base-url "https://base";
        resource "bar" {
            url "{../base-url}/bar"; # https://base/bar
        }
    }

To define a block where the option is to be located the following syntax is used:

    block-type[([name [, class]])]

For example:

    resource "default" {
        url "https://localhost";
    }
    resource "test1" addr {
        component "foo"
    }
    client-data {
        url "{/resource(default)/url}/{/resource("test1", addr)/component}"; # https://localhost/foo
    }

Referring to a nested block can be done as in the following example:

    resource "default" {
        urls {
            base "https://localhost";
        }
    }
    client-data {
        user-profile "{/resource(default)/urls/base}/user"; # https://localhost/user
    }

Symbol escaping is traditionally done with a backslash:

    client-data {
        description "Some basic info \{?} \\";
    }

=head2 Environment

Environment variables are expanded with C<"{$HOME}"> syntax. For example:

    base-dir "{$HOME}/.myapp";

Normally, if requested environment variable doesn't exists the parser would throw
C<Config::BINDish::X::Macro::DoesntExists> exception. But if the variable name is followed
with a question mark sign then the macro would be expanded into an empty string:

    default-prefix "{$MYAPP_PFX?}";
    table-prefix "{default-prefix}my_table";

=head2 This Is A Value!

I<Actually, this is a
L<C<Config::BINDish::AST::Container>|rakudoc:Config::BINDish::AST::Container>.
And a
L<C<Config::BINDish::AST::Node>|rakudoc:Config::BINDish::AST::Node>.
But as long as we talk about option values, so â€“ let it be a value then.>

Because expandable strings are normal values they can be used anywhere, where a value is accepted. We can do things
like expanding a string within a macro:

    default-server "A1";
    server "A1" {
        url "https://a1.local";
    }
    server "A2" {
        url "https://a2.local";
    }
    network "Office" {
        api-url "{/server("{/default-server}")}/api"; # https://a1.local/api
    }

This works because when a macro is expanded server name and class can be specified using string values.
